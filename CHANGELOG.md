# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.2] 2023-04-36
- Fixed issue 100 - an unfortunate bug where if the user does not specify the `--tui-fold-level` option, the HTML report will not render individual test cases correctly (they won't open/close when clicked). `--tui-fold-level ` is still supported but now if user does not specify it, the level defaults to WARNING, and displays the new Foldedd Output section anyway.
- Fixed minor issue with bash test script not installing faker lib.
- Fixed exception issue when specifying non-default output filename for HTML report.

## [1.9.1] 2023-03-30
- Re-implemented the folding feature for HTML report. This version doesn't rely on the user having to do anything with their tests other than smartly partition their log statements into the proper debug levels for their application (i.e. no clunky logfile shananigans). The folding feature automatically folds all log output that is less than a configurable level. This is controlled with new command line option '--tui-fold-level'. Also, there is a new 'Actions' button in the HTML which folds/unfolds all fold sections.
- Fix sticky issue with topbar.
- Pin requirements with pip-tools.

## [1.9.0] 2023-03-20
- Added initial implementation for foldable HTML lines (see docstring on class TuiLogger in tui_logger.py for details). This feature is experimental.
- Minor improvements to HTML report "About" page.

## [1.8.0] 2023-01-30
- New command-line option `tui-reportfile', which allows user to specify the name of the HTML file produced when the console script `tuih` is run.

## [1.7.2] 2023-01-29
- Fixed Issue 94 (KeyError when user env has no JAVA_HOME).

## [1.7.1] 2023-01-28
- Fixed Issue 84 (dataclass exception with Python 3.11).

## [1.7.0] 2023-01-12

- Implemented internal tracking of Rerun tests.
- Added Rerun test sections to the HTML page.
- Added duration to existing start and stop times for test session.
- Changed look 'n' feel of About page in the HTML report (uses accordian buttons now).
- Moved initalization of pytest-tui-specific Config object attributes from pytest-sessionstart to pytest_cmdline_main, as that method seems to be visited by the code earlier. This is to prevent AttributeError seen while testing latest build: "AttributeError: 'Config' object has no attribute '_tui_test_results'."
- Internal implementation of pickling now uses a single file for TestReport and Section data. The pickled data is in the form of a dict, and also has some timedate info in it.
- Tweaked and formatted a bunch of the tests in /demo-tests.
## [1.6.1] 2022-09-23

- Added '*' .gitignore to ptt_files/ so that when people run pytest --tui in other directories they don't see the ptt_files/ dir.

## [1.6.0] - 2022-09-20

- Addressed issue 63:
  - Fixed tuih and tui console scripts not running
  - Removed autolaunch feature (TUI and HTML pages must now be launched by the user using 'tui' or 'tuih')
  - Removed config script 'tuiconf'
- Pinned dependencies.
- Added pytest-metadata to dependencies.
- Removed bullet from dependencies.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-09-16

- Added "All Tests" results tab.
- Removed "nth child" css code which was masking result button highlighting on hover.
- Added start_time and outcome to each test result button in HTML.

## [1.4.3] - 2022-09-14

- Fixed yet another crash issue when `pytest` was invoked by itself: `INTERNALERROR> AttributeError: 'Config' object has no attribute '_tui_test_results'`
- Removed some unnecessary import in setup.py

## [1.4.2] - 2022-09-14

- Fixed issue 66: refactored globals in plugin.py to reside within pytest Config object, rendering impossible the previous weirdness when files were attempted to be close that either didn't exist, or we re already closed.

## [1.4.1] - 2022-09-07

- Fixed issue where if pytest was invoked only with `--version` flag, a `ResourceWarning: unclosed file` message was generated.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-04

- Open up HTML real estate with dropdown containing console output sections (which are presumably lesser-used).
- Make autolaunch False by default for both TUI and HTML.

## [1.3.3] - 2022-09-04

- Fixed error msg re: open file at end of run when pytest is run w/o --tui option.
- Fixed persistent non-wrapping <pre> text in HTML output.

## [1.3.2] - 2022-08-31

- Fixed issue where 'passes_section' was being rendered even if no Passed testcases.

## [1.3.1] - 2022-08-27

- Tweaked colors.
- Cleaned up CSS a bit.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-08-27

- Changed to output HTML as one file, with all included CSS and JS content. This makes it portable when sharing results files.
- Removed unuse "Reruns" section. Reruns are still supported, just not broken out individually. This is more in line with how pytest treats the Reruns section anyway. Reruns are categorized P/F/S/XP/XF just as normal tests are.
- Remove duplicate 'lastline' in About section.
- Implemented dynamic inclusion/removal of section and results tabs, depending on if they have content or not.
- Added 'sticky' CSS styling to top-bar buttons. The top bar now shows up even when scrolling down long pages.
- Fixed a few persistent ANSI issues: no blue markup (was misssing CSS for \x1b94m, 'bright blue'); and non-marked-up section content.

## [1.2.1] - 2022-08-22

- Revamp console-line categorization algorithm to accomodate variations in user environment more easily
- Add support for `live log` sections
- Fix multiple bugs (although several remain)

## [1.2.0] - 2022-08-19

- Working/revamped HTML file output, with more modern look/feel.
- Fixed tui1 (Textual) so that it works with new internal implementation.
- Retiring tui2 (PyTermTk) for now.
- Reordered/removed some menu items in tuiconf to fit new content/choices.
- Changed output files folder to ./ptt_files.

## [1.1.3] - 2022-08-13

- Fixed bug where if config file existed but was empty, an exception would occur on launching HTML file.

## [1.1.2] - 2022-08-10

- Added chronological results section.
- Cleaned up HTML.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-08-08

- Added TUI autolaunch config variable (default False).
- Cleaned up HTML, and added Metadata show/hide button.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-08-07

- Refactored HTML code to fix several small but annoying issues.
- Added new configuration console script `tuiconf` that allows user to change/store settings for:
  - TUI choice (`tui1` (Textual) or `tui2` (PyTermTk))
  - HTML "light" or "dark" page coloring scheme
  - HTML autolaunch (y or n)
  - Custom coloring capability for HTML scheme
- Removed old `tui1` and `tui2` console scripts, replacing with a single `tui` version that launches the configured TUI as set using `tuiconf`
- Added new console script `tuih`, which creates and optionally launches the HTML output from the last testrun session.
- Changed name of output file folder to /pytest_tui_files. This is where the .bin and .html files now reside.
- Fixed issue where if no tests were run and either TUI was launched, they would crash.
- Replaced previous dummy environment button data with actual environment data from pytests's output.

## [1.0.1] - 2022-08-02

- Implemented threading in final testing stage so that HTML and TUI can be launched at the same time.
- Fixed --co bug where TUIs were called although no tests had been run.
- Added this changelog.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-08-01

- Refactored individual results classification to use pytest's 'short test summary info' section, instead of TestReport outcome. This ensures that pytest-tui results are always the same as those of pytest itself.
- Implemented basic HTML report.
- Updated folder structure to place .bin and .html output files in /release.
