RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

# TESTING
- `pytest --version` completes without error and shows correct version
- `pytest` runs without any tests to execute (should show 'no tests ran')
- `pytest` runs on new venv with only pytest-tui installed, and some tests, and w/o a ptt_files folder in place
- 'pytest --tui' runs on new venv with only pytest-tui installed, and some tests, and w/o a ptt_files folder in place

# RELEASE
- Verify package installs and runs correctly locally (from toplevel):
  cd <dev-direcory>
  pip install -e .

- Install/upgrade build & release tools:
  pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

- Clear out old builds:
  rm dist/*

- Build:
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

- Publish to TestPyPi:
  python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

- Test the installation in a fresh directory:
  cd ~
  mkdir pytest-tui-testing
  cd pytest-tui-testing
  pyenv local 3.10.5
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pytest-tui
  mkdir -p ./demo-tests/ && cp ../pytest-tui/demo-tests/* ./demo-tests/

- Verify basic functionality without plugin:
  pytest

- Verify basic functionality with plugin:
  pytest --tui

- Run through battery of tests (flesh this out):
  use tuiconf
  try both TUIs
  try both light and dark themes
  try custom coloring

- Make any adjustments required, then git-commit and push, then start over at step 1

- Publish to Pypi:
  cd <dev-directory>
  python -m twine upload dist/*
